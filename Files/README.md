In summary, our analysis found that the Random Forest classifier outperformed the traditional Logistic Regression model and other machine learning techniques. It proved to be more efficient, utilizing less than half the computational resources required by Gradient Boosting, and achieved an accuracy rate of 88% in predicting the next day’s stock price movement. The study successfully identified key features influencing price action, such as support and resistance levels, price metrics (minimum, maximum, average prices over the past 30 days), the volatility index, moving averages, the timing of key economic reports (CPI, PCE, Jobs, and FOMC), the behavior of the S&P 500, and trading volume.
According to the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), financial markets are considered "informationally efficient," meaning asset prices reflect all available information—both public and private—at any given time. As our analysis is based on historical data, there is inherent risk involved, and financial losses can occur without proper research and risk management. Short-term investors and traders often seek to profit from market anomalies, misinterpreted information, and behavioral biases. Therefore, passively managed index funds are frequently recommended for those seeking to match market returns rather than exceed them.
Furthermore, continued research into complex feature interactions is crucial for advancing predictive modeling and machine learning. By exploring how different features interact, researchers and practitioners can develop models that are not only more accurate but also more interpretable and applicable to real-world scenarios.

**DISCLAIMER:** The results and conclusions drawn from this study are based on historical data and machine learning models. Past performance is not indicative of future results, and investing in financial markets carries risks. It is important to conduct thorough research and implement robust risk management strategies before making investment decisions.
